| `REPOSITORIES` | - | **Required** New line deliminator regex expressions to select repositories. Repositories are limited to those in which the token user is an owner or collaborator. |
| `WORKFLOW_FILES` | - | **Required** New line deliminator regex expressions. workflow files to be copied to provided repositories |
| `DRY_RUN` | ***false*** | Run everything except for nothing will be pushed. |
| `WORKFLOW_FILES_DIR` | ***workflows*** | Local Path Where Common Workflow Files Are Located ***Eg : `workflows`*** |
| `AUTO_CREATE_NEW_BRANCH` | ***false*** | Auto create new branch in a repository if the branch dose not exists |
| `COMMIT_EACH_FILE` | ***false*** | if you need to keep track of each file's commit history separate then set it to true |
| `PULL_REQUEST` | **false** | Set to `true` if you want the changes to be pushed via pull request. |

| `COMMIT_MESSAGE` | **false** | You can provide your custom commit message. |

### Personal Access Token Scope
#### [Github Personal Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=gh-workflow-sync)  <small> Is required with the below scope </small>

> Full ***Repo*** is only required when you need to update private repository
> if your are updating only public repository then just select `public_repo` inside ***repo*** scope

### `REPOSITORIES` Configuration Examples
<details><summary><strong>Repository With Default Branch</strong></summary>

```yaml
REPOSITORIES: |
    username/repo
    username/repo2
```

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Repository With Custom Branch</strong></summary>

```yaml
REPOSITORIES: |
    username/repo@dev
    username/repo1@dev2
```
> You Can also have same repository multiple times if you provide different branch name
</details>

---

### `WORKFLOW_FILES` Configuration Examples

1. If you use `=` as a file separator `file1.md=myfile.md` then `file1` from the current repository will be copied to remote repository with the name of `myfile.md`
1. If you use `!=` as a file separator `file1.md!=myfile.md` then `file1` from the current repository will be copied to remote repository with the name of `myfile.md` only if `myfile.md` already not exists in the remote repository

<details><summary><strong>Files - Source & Destination File Without Custom Name</strong></summary>

```yaml
WORKFLOW_FILES: |
    dependabot.yml
    .github/settings.yml
```
> **dependabot.yml** will save in root folder in the repository
>
> **.github/settings.yml** will save in `.github` in the repository

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Files - Source File In Root & Destination File In Custom Location</strong></summary>

```yaml
WORKFLOW_FILES: |
    hello-bot.yml=.github/
    pr-bot.yml=.github/pull-request.yml
```
> **hello-bot.yml** will save in `.github` in the repository with the same name
>
> **pr-bot.yml** will save in `.github` in the repository with the name `pull-request.yml`
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Folders - Source & Destination Folders Without Custom Name</strong></summary>

```yaml
WORKFLOW_FILES: |
    folder1
    .github/folder2
```
> **folder1** will save in root folder in the repository
>
> **.github/folder2** will save in `.github` in the repository

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Folders - Source & Destination Folders With Custom Name</strong></summary>

```yaml
WORKFLOW_FILES: |
    folder1=./save-to-folder
    .github/folder2=custom-folder/save-to-folder2
```
> **folder1** will save inside `REPOSITORY ROOT` in the name of `save-to-folder`
>
> **.github/folder2** will save inside `custom-folder` in the name of `save-to-folder2`

</details>

## How Files Sync Work ?
Before copying the **WORKFLOW_FILES** from the source to destination. this action will provide some flexibility.
this searches for a file in various locations for example lets take `settings.yml` as the file that you want to sync for multiple repository

#### Below are the locations that this action search for the file/folder
* `./{OWNER}/{REPO_NAME}/workflows/{filename}`
* `./{OWNER}/workflows/{filename}`
* `./{WORKFLOW_FILES_DIR}/{filename}`
* `./.github/workflows/{filename}`
* `./{OWNER}/{REPO_NAME}/{filename}`
* `./{OWNER}/{filename}`
* `./{filename}`

> if the `settings.yml` is found inside `workflows` folder then the destination is automatically forced to `.github/workflows` in the destination repo
>
> if the `settings.yml` is outside of `workflows` folder then the destination then its copied to the destination

### How this can be useful ?
Lets assume that you want to maintain all the common github files in a single repository and suddenly a repository needs a single file to be changed in that case instead of editing the action yml file. you can just create a folder like `{REPO_OWNER}/{REPO_NAME}/{FILE}` to copy the overriden file to the destination


## üöÄ Usage

Create a new file in `.github/workflows/` named **workflow-sync.yml** and copy & paste the below file content

#### `workflow-sync.yml` content
```yaml
name: Workflow Sync

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
env:
  DRY_RUN: false
  REPOSITORIES: |
  
  WORKFLOW_FILES: |

jobs:
  Github_Workflow_Sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetching Local Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Running Workflow Sync
        uses: mo-auto/actions-sync-workflows@main
        with:
          DRY_RUN: ${{ env.DRY_RUN }}
          REPOSITORIES: ${{ env.REPOSITORIES }}
          WORKFLOW_FILES: ${{ env.WORKFLOW_FILES }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

```

## Troubleshooting

### Spacing
Spacing around the equal sign is important. For example, this will not work:

```yaml
WORKFLOW_FILES: |
  folder/file-sync.yml = folder/test.txt
```

It passes to the shell file 3 distinct objects

* folder/file-sync.ymll
* =
* folder/test.txt

instead of 1 object

* folder/file-sync.yml = folder/test.txt

and there is nothing I can do in code to make up for that

### Slashes

You do not need (nor want) leading `/` for the file path on either side of the equal sign

The only time you need `/` trailing is for folder copies. 
While a file copy will technically still work with a leading `/`, a folder copy will not
